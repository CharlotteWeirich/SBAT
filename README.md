# SBAT
A simple browser-based annotation tool.

Done:
- allow for simple binary annotation
- display the annotated data at the end of annotating
- allow for file upload of .txt and .json files
- allow for download of .json files of the annotated data
- allow for different label sets including more than two labels
- allow download while annotation is not finished
- save label set to downloaded file
- allow pagination with one text of context
- add an option for keyboard shortcuts and for setting those
- expand pagination option for more texts of context
- fix the shortcut function bug that occurs when clicking it multiple times

To do:
- implement a welcome page and hide the settings when they're not needed
- implement a way to navigte the texts without setting labels
- show the label of the current text
- make pagination vertical instead of horizontal
- give a warning when closing the window
- improve the JSON structure
- make it so you can set labels at any point
- work on some CSS

Future features:
- allow for setting multiple labels for one text
- implement hierarchical label sets
- provide views and only step through instances that meet certain criteria
- add Github integration
