# SBAT
A simple browser-based annotation tool.

Done:
- allow for simple binary annotation
- display the annotated data at the end of annotating
- allow for file upload of .txt and .json files
- allow for download of .json files of the annotated data

To do:
- allow for different label sets including more than two labels
- add an option for keyboard shortcuts and for setting those
- allow pagination, for showing context, instead of just one text per page
